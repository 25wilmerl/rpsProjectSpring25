// "List of steps for project"

 Steps:
1. /*You need to make a new GitHub repo for this. 
In that repo you will need index.html, and rps.js*/

2. /*Copy the index.html code from an old repo, make the script link to rps.js*/

3.  /*Save your work to GitHub (git status -> git add -> git commit -> git push origin main)*/

4. /*In rps.js, you are going to make "pseudocode" for your game.  Write out every 
step that you need to do to play the game.  We're going to use multiple functions 
to play the game, so you'll to write each of these functions.*/

5.  /*Once you've completed your pseudocode, commit rps.js to GitHub (commit -m "completed pseudocode")*/

6.  /*write the actual code.  (I'd commit after you finish each function)*/

7.  /*When it's all said and done, I will help you get GitHub to host this webpage, 
so that you can play it from anywhere.*/

Here are some things that might help you:
1 function should be getting the computer's choice for that round
(Math.random() lets you get a random number, you can use stuff to help that choose between 3 choices)

1 function should get the human's choice.  (prompt() is a good option here).

when we're completely done with this project, it will be a first player to 
5 wins version of the game.  Make variables to keep track of the score.

Once you've written the functions to get choices, write code to play just 
one round, and make sure that's working properly, before you expand to the first 5 version.  

MAKE SURE:  when the winner is declared, it should give a message like "You win!  Paper beats rock!"  
Or "You lose!  Scissors beats paper!"  Messages like "Sorry, you lose" or "Congrats you win", don't 
make your player trust that the program is fair.
